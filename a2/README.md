# Brainz Plugin for the Revolt Chat Client

- It is highly recommended to download the revolt client before using this instead of a browser due to the chance of it loading multiple times (each opened tab of Browser Revolt)
------

1. To set your brainz username you can run the following (replacing `<username>` with yours)before running the plugin script:
> ```js
> localStorage.setItem("brainz-user", "<username>")
> ```

2. Copy/paste [the script](https://github.com/RevoltBots/plugins/blob/main/a2/brainz.plugin.js) into the client dev-console and then your (hopefully) set to go!
